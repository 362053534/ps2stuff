General/About
-------------

ps2stuff is, as the name implies, a collection of stuff that I have
found useful for ps2 development.  ps2stuff is most notably used by ps2gl,
which generally motivates new releases.


Documentation
-------------

Hmm... I should probably write some.  The header files are all the
documentation that exists now...

Compiling
---------

ps2stuff uses the UberMakefile, developed here at SCEA R&D.  There is
some documentation at the top of the Makefile, but here is a
quickstart:

You'll usually do 'make [buildname] [target]' where buildname is one
of the build names listed in Makefile.builds and target is usually
'clean' or nothing.  If no build is given then the environment
variable BUILDNAME is used, if that is not defined then the
DEFAULTBUILD specified in the Makefile is used.  So 'make' will build
the default build given in the Makefile, 'make linux' will build a
linux build, and 'make optimized' will build a native (non-linux) build.

Conventions
-----------

If you're modifiying existing code, follow the conventions for that module,
otherwise use standard conventions.

Here are the conventions I use: local stuff starts with lowercase, non-local
with uppercase and an optional lowercase prefix, "someVar" not "some_var,"
constants start with 'k', macros start with 'm', classes start with 'C'.

Please don't use the c preprocessor unless absolutely necessary; inlines instead
of macros, and "static const float SomeVariable = 1.0f" not "#define
SOME_VARIABLE 1.0f."  There is no memory or speed disadvantage to either of
the above.
